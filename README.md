NCAA Basketball Elo Analysis

This began as a school project, and may (hopefully) mature into a system that my friend can use to make overall winning bets on ncaa basketball games.

The system uses the chess rating system to rank teams (Nate Silver on www.fivethirtyeight.com does similar stuff). It builds a database of matchups and records differences in rating, odds set by oddsmakers, and the actual result of the game. This database can then be analyzed to look for patterns (lopsided matchups, close matchups, etc.) and make predictions about teams covering their respective spreads.
